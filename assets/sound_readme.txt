Sound Asset Instructions:

You need to place a sound file named "sound.wav" in this directory.

Recommended sound file:
- Format: WAV, MP3, or OGG
- Duration: Short (0.1-0.5 seconds)
- Type: Simple beep or click sound
- Volume: Moderate (will be adjustable in code)

You can:
1. Record a simple "beep" sound using QuickTime Player or Audacity
2. Download a free sound effect from freesound.org
3. Use macOS built-in sounds from /System/Library/Sounds/

For testing, you can copy a system sound:
cp /System/Library/Sounds/Tink.aiff assets/sound.wav

Note: The application will look for "sound.wav" in this directory.
